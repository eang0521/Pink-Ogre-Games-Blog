I have played many board games in the past few years, and here is are 5 of my favorites.

**1. Caverna**
Caverna is definitely the best worker placement game I've ever played. While I rarely win games, I still feel a sense of accomplishment after every game. The furnishing tiles add multiple ways to score, and there are numerous strategies that I've tried. The only downside is its time; a game takes about half an hour for each player, which can quickly add up. However, if you don't mind two-player time shouldn't be an issue. This game is definitely a must have.

**2. Twilight Imperium**
This is one of the two longest games I own, but it is, in my opinion, the better of the two. (The other is Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization) The theme fits very well with the mechanics. I really like how the whole game is about politics; almost everything you do could affect your opponents. This leads to some tense interactions, as well as some exciting negotiations. As in Caverna, however, time is an issue, even more so. Twilight Imperium takes over 5 hours (I play the 4th version), although it has fairly little downtime.

**3. Terraforming Mars**
I recently got this game, and as soon as I started playing, I loved it! There are so many different paths to victory, and the different Corporations affect your strategy every game. For its size, it doesn't take very long either! It doesn't feel as heavy as other games, and definitely is more suitable for a casual gamer than the games I have listed above.

**4. Gloomhaven**
While this might not be a traditional board game, it is still loads of fun. The unique mechanics, along with the attack modifier deck, make it a great RPG. I've never really gotten into role-playing games, so this one has really raised my respect and interest in them. I enjoy the cooperative aspect of the game, as well as the fact that every win is a step forward in a longer battle.

**5. Space Trader**
It might be weird for someone to put his own game in a list of his favorites, but I'm doing it anyway. I really like some of the games I've designed, but this is by far my favorite. It plays in 20 minutes, but packs as much fun as possible into that short time span. But don't take my word for it! Be sure to check out Space Trader if and when I publish it!
