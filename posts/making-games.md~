I have *loved* board games for most of my life. At first, it was simple games, like Uno, or Monopoly (which I have only recently finished a game of). But then there were more complex games. Dominion was one of my favorite games when I first got to play it.

From a young age, then, I have always wanted to play board games of all kinds. I would even venture out to make my own "games", although most of the time, they were just combinations of already existing games.

Recently though, I have begun designing better board games. One of my recent ones, [Space Trader](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/space-trader5), is actually pretty fun, although I am biased.
